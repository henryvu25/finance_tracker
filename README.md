# finance_tracker

This project is for a finance tracker application that enables the user to track their assets and liabilities: bank accounts, credit cards, bills, subscriptions, goals and retirement planning. 

The application will utilize a relational database to store persisting user data. There will be forms on the user interface to fill in and post to the database and the app will be able to display the data in a readable and manageable format that can help the user oversee their finances.
